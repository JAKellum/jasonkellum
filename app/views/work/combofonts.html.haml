          %h5 Webfont Combination Application (Preview)
          %p Combofonts is a personal project I've been working on which takes the google library of webfonts and provides ideal font pairs. The application asks a series of questions based on the tone and mood of the context, provides a few alternative results, and then gives the markup to include in any website. It is targeted towards developers or those who are not as familiar with typography.
